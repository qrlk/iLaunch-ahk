## info
This is an [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script to control [iTunes For Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/itunes/9PB2MZ1ZMB1S) via global hotkeys.  
This script is a successful attempt to extend the functionality of http://www.ke5fx.com/ilaunch/readme.htm.

It uses the 'iTunes COM Interface'.  
Unfortunately, this interface has not been updated for many years.

Some must-have features, such as deleting a track from the library without confirmation or setting a 'liked' or 'disliked' mark, could not be implemented.

Tested using iTunes 12.12.6.1, COM v1.3
